Given an Undirected Graph having unit weight, find the shortest path from the source to all other nodes in this graph. In this problem statement, we have assumed the source vertex to be ‘0’. If a vertex is unreachable from the source node, then return -1 for that vertex.

Time Complexity: O(M) { for creating the adjacency list from given list ‘edges’} + O(N + 2M) { for the BFS Algorithm} + O(N) { for adding the final values of the shortest path in the resultant array} ~ O(N+2M). 

Where N= number of vertices and M= number of edges.

Space Complexity:  O( N) {for the stack storing the BFS} + O(N) {for the resultant array} + O(N) {for the dist array storing updated shortest paths} + O( N+2M) {for the adjacency list} ~ O(N+M) .

Where N= number of vertices and M= number of edges.
