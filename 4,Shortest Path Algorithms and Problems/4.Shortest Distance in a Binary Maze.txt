Problem Statement: 

Given an n * m matrix grid where each element can either be 0 or 1. You need to find the shortest distance between a given source cell to a destination cell. The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1. 

If the path is not possible between the source cell and the destination cell, then return -1.

Note: You can move into an adjacent cell if that adjacent cell is filled with element 1. Two cells are adjacent if they share a side. In other words, you can move in one of four directions, Up, Down, Left, and Right.
