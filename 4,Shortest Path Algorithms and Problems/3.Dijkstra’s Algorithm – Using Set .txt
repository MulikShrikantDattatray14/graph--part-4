Given a weighted, undirected, and connected graph of V vertices and an adjacency list adj where adj[i] is a list of lists containing two integers where the first integer of each list j denotes there is an edge between i and j, second integers corresponds to the weight of that edge. You are given the source vertex S and You have to Find the shortest distance of all the vertex from the source vertex S. You have to return a list of integers denoting the shortest distance between each node and Source vertex S.

Note: The Graph doesn’t contain any negative weight cycle
